# ChuggGPT AI Helpdesk

AI-Native IT Support Operations Platform

## System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](screenshots/architecture-diagram.png)


ChuggGPT AI Helpdesk is an AI-powered IT support platform built with FastAPI, WebSockets, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Jinja2, and the OpenAI API. It helps users submit support tickets, receive AI-guided troubleshooting in real time, and enables admins to manage ticket operations through a centralized dashboard.

## Overview

This project was built to simulate a modern AI-native IT helpdesk experience. It combines classic support workflows with AI ticket triage, live troubleshooting chat, automation execution, and audit logging.

ChuggGPT is designed to feel like an early-stage SaaS platform rather than just a basic CRUD app.

# How the System Works

## Ticket Submission

A user submits an IT support ticket including:

- device type
- urgency level
- issue description

---

## AI Ticket Triage

After submission, the AI system analyzes the ticket and predicts:

- category
- severity
- business impact
- automation possibilities

The result is stored in the database.

---

## Real-Time AI Support Chat

A chat session is automatically created.

The AI agent:

- guides troubleshooting
- asks follow-up questions
- can trigger automations
- escalates issues when needed

---

## Automation Execution

Automations simulate real IT operations such as:

- flushing DNS
- restarting printers
- resetting network configurations
- disk cleanup

Each automation is logged for auditing.

---

## Admin Dashboard

Admins can:

- review tickets
- claim tickets
- update statuses
- execute automations
- review audit logs

---
